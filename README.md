# AAL TEBÄ°GEP 2022 August Education Program
This is a repo for sharing our resources, education materials and documents created in class with our students and the rest of our members. Each course that we offer in this program have their own folders and within them, the materials are categorised according to the tutor of the course section. In some you may find well explained notes but in others you will face hastily written codes.

## Have Fun Experimenting With the Files
You can clone this repo on your computer and experiment with the materials locally. If you think that an addition or a correction can/should be made and you do not have permission. You can create a new issue that explains the problem and the solution that you suggest, explained clearly.
