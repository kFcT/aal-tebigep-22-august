# Homework 3 / exercise 5

## Assignment:
Given an int array of length n, create a new array with the same elements of the initial one but with the inverse order and print it **without** using `Arrays.toString(int[])` in the form:
> [3, 5, 6, 1, 45, 34, 7, 10, 9]

Let the user decide the length of the initial array and the elements by prompting the user and obtaining input via `Scanner(System.in)`.
